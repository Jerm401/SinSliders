**Sin Game: How to Play**

**Objective**
- Earn 4 Mercy Tokens with 0 Mortal Sins to reach Heaven and win.
- Alternatively, enter Purgatory with 3 Mercy Tokens and 0 Mortal Sins, gaining protection from Mortal Sins until earning one more Mercy Token to win.

**Losing the Game**
- Earning 4 Mortal Sins sends a player to Hell, eliminating them from the game.

**Gameplay Overview**
1. Each player (sinner) starts by drawing 3 Sin Cards.
2. One player becomes the Pope for the round (highest die roll).
3. Each sinner plays a Sin Card face down.
4. The Pope shuffles and ranks the sins from least (Venial) to most (Mortal).
5. Players may debate and influence the Pope’s judgment.
6. The most severe sins receive a Mortal Sin Token and a Curse Card.
7. The least severe sins receive a Mercy Token and a Blessing Card.
8. The Pope excommunicates one player, preventing them from confessing that round.
9. Other players may confess to remove Mortal Sins (rolling a 4-6 succeeds).
10. A new Pope is assigned, and players refill their hands to 3 cards.

**Confession**
- Players may roll a die at the end of the round to remove all Mortal Sins (4-6 succeeds).
- The Pope may excommunicate one player, denying them confession.

**Blessing and Curse Cards**
- Affect gameplay positively or negatively.
- Instant Play Cards resolve immediately.
- Board Cards are played face down before Sin Cards and take effect after judging.

**Purgatory Rules**
- Entered when a player has 3 Mercy Tokens and 0 Mortal Sins.
- While in Purgatory, a player cannot receive Mortal Sins.
- Must earn one more Mercy Token to win.
- Players in Purgatory receive a Blessing Card upon entry.

**Weird Situations**
- A maximum of 2 Grave Matter Tokens can be given per round.
- If multiple players reach Heaven simultaneously, the closest to the Pope wins.
- If only 2 players remain, Mercy Tokens minus Mortal Sins determine the winner.
- Mercy/Mortal Sin Tokens from Blessing/Curse Cards are applied after the next round’s judging.

**Example Cards**
- *Scrupulous Priest (Blessing - Instant):* Confession requires rolling a 6.
- *Priestly Mishap (Curse - Instant):* No confessions this round.
- *Thief of Mercy (Curse):* Steal a Mercy Token from another player.
- *Sin Cards:*
  - *Mouth Open:* Chew loudly, annoying others.
  - *Slow Walking:* Walk deliberately slow to exert control.
